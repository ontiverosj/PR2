I can captured  basic information about the individual by getting, Name, firstname, last name, age, email, phone number. 
I ussed inputs and labels to help creat the information I needed to get for the basic imforation I am need for my website.
the benifit of using for example the age tag will allow me to get  people of what age our on my website so I can tweek my products on the website. 
the disadvantage is age you can have a whole variety of consumers with a whole variety of ages buying the same product. 
based off of the information I am getting. I use the imforamtion to get basic imformation from and for the user and while they give me that information I am allowing then to get into the "website" also allowing to retrieve access again to give them access again.
